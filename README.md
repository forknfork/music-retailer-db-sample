# SQLite Sample Project

This is a record of my self-guided exploration of data in the [SQLite Tutorial](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/) [Sample Database](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/), which simulates music retailer data. The questions asked by [Alyssa Vigil](https://discuss.codecademy.com/u/alyssavigil/summary) in her ["Data Science Independent Project #2 â€“ Explore a Sample Database"](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/data-science-independent-project-2-explore-a-sample-database/419945) project on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/about) are as follows:

- Which tracks appeared in the most playlists? How many playlists did they appear in?
- Which track generated the most revenue? Which album? Which genre?
- Which countries have the highest sales revenue? What percent of total revenue does each country make up?
- How many customers did each employee support, what is the average revenue for each sale, and what is their total sale?
- Do longer or shorter length albums tend to generate more revenue?
- Is the number of times a track appear in any playlist a good indicator of sales?
- How much revenue is generated each year, and what is its percent change from the previous year?
